# String

- Python string is the collection of the characters surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, or      triple quotes.

- The computer does not understand the characters; internally, it stores manipulated character as the combination of the 0's and 1's.

- Each character is encoded in the ASCII or Unicode character. So we can say that Python strings are also called the collection of Unicode characters.

- Strings are immutable in Python.

- We use Unicode Strings

- Negative Index supports in python

# String Operators

- Pluse (+) operator is used to concatinate the strings

- Astrics (*) operator :- It is known as repetition operator. It concatenates the multiple copies of the same string.

- Brackets [] opeartor :- It is known as slice operator. It is used to access the sub-strings of a particular string.

- Bracket with semicoln [:] Operator :- It is known as range slice operator. It is used to access the characters from the specified range.

- in Operator :- It is known as membership operator. It returns if a particular sub-string is present in the specified string.

- not in Operator :- It is also a membership operator and does the exact reverse of in. It returns true if a particular substring is not present in the specified string.

- r/R (Raw) Operator :- It is used to specify the raw string. Raw strings are used in the cases where we need to print the actual meaning of escape characters such as "C://python". 

- % modulo Operator :- It is used to perform string formatting. It makes use of the format specifiers used in C programming like %d or %f to map their values in python. We will discuss how formatting is done in python.
